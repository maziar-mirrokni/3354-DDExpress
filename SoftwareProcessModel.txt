We will be using incremental development. The incremental method will drastically reduce the cost of implementing
requirements changes, as well as reducing the amount of analysis and documentation required so that we can focus more on
the development of the app itself. It also allows us easier access to customer feedback so that we can continue to improve
and refine the design of our app to make it easy to use for everyone.
